            About me 
            
            Hi! Iâ€˜m Fay!

â€” a young creative mind whoâ€˜s interested in discovering the many different sides and aspects of design.


I like to create things that last and show my thoughts about them alongside it for creatives of all skill levels and even people outside our profession to enjoy and grow withâ€” always discovering something new, while putting your best into it.


Since the quote â€žWrite the book that you want to readâ€œ is one that I always related to Iâ€˜d like to show others what I wish I had learned ages ago instead of stupid â€žinspirational quotesâ€œ by fake gurus; for others and myself
