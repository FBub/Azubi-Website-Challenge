            <p>Hi! I‘m Fay!</p><br>
            <p>— a young creative mind who‘s interested in discovering the many different sides and aspects of design.</p><br>           
            <p>I like to create things that last and show my thoughts about them alongside it for creatives of all skill levels and even people outside our profession to enjoy and grow with— always discovering something new, while putting your best into it.</p><br>
            <p>Since the quote „Write the book that you want to read“ is one that I always related to I‘d like to show others what I wish I had learned ages ago instead of stupid „inspirational quotes“ by fake gurus; for others and myself.</p>
